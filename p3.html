    <h1>Assignment 3 __ Reading #1  Systems & Complexity</h1>
      

<h2>
Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
</h2>
<h3>
A system can be defined as a set of interrelated components that work together to achieve a common goal or purpose. A system can be viewed as a whole, with the components within the system interacting and influencing each other. A set cannot be called a system if the individuals within the set do not interact with each other, or even exclude each other.
</h3>
<br>

<h2>
Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.

</h2>
<h4>
Modularity
<br>
<p style="color:#ffffff;">Modularity refers to the concept of dividing a complex system into smaller, independent units or modules that can function independently but interact with each other. An example of modularity can be computer systems.</p>
Decomposability
<br>
<p style="color:#ffffff;">
Decomposability refers to the ability to break down a complex system into smaller, simpler components. For example, by breaking down the human system into individual organs, it is possible to know the specific role of each organ for the person.</p>
Emergence <br>
<p style="color:#ffffff;"> Emergence is a phenomenon in which many small entities interact to produce a large entity that exhibits properties not possessed by the small entities that make it up. Snowflake formation is an emergent phenomenon.</p>
Chaos Theory<br>
<p style="color:#ffffff;">Chaos theory deals with systems characterized by nonlinear equations that produce seemingly random or chaotic behavior, even if they are determined by fundamental rules. An example of chaos theory can be seen in the field of weather forecasting, where small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different weather patterns over time.</p>

</h4>

<br>

<h2>
Q3. -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other?

</h2>
<h3>
Although both concepts are systematized from small to large, from simple to complex. However, there is still a difference between the two. Modularity refers to the concept of dividing a complex system into smaller, independent units or modules that can function independently but interact with each other. Tessellation, on the other hand, consists of a continuous repetition of individuals covering a tile plane without any gaps or overlaps. 
The two are also opposite. In contrast to tessellation, which is characterized by uniformity, modularity has independence. Modularity enables the combination of independent individuals into a system.
</h3>
<br>

<h2>
Q4. -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)

</h2>
<h3>
Designing a complex (aperiodic) system requires more understanding of the behavior of its components and their interactions, while designing a unified (periodic) system focuses on the simplicity and regularity of the system structure.

</h3>
<br>

<h2>
Q5. -- What is the difference between a system diagram and some kind of feature diagram like an exploded view drawing or an illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentences.

</h2>

<h3>
System diagrams focus on the structure and function of the system, while feature diagrams focus on the characteristics of the system.
